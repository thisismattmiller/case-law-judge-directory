After Illinois became a state in 1818, the state legislature appointed Browne as one of the Illinois Supreme Court’s four justices. In 1841, the legislature divided Illinois into nine circuits, and each of the justices on the expanded supreme court held court in one of the circuits. Browne was responsible for the 6th Judicial Circuit. In 1843, four members of the bar from Galena, Illinois, petitioned the Illinois House of Representatives for the removal of Browne as judge of the 6th Judicial Circuit for incompetence, but Abraham Lincoln, as attorney for Browne, successfully argued to have the charges dropped. Browne held his seat on the bench until 1848, when a new state constitution reduced the number of justices from nine to three. Justice Browne died in San Francisco, c. 1858.\t\t\t\t",

In 1835, the General Assembly appointed him state’s attorney for   the First Judicial Circuit. Douglas was elected to the state legislature in   1836, and in the same year, he accepted the position of Register of the Land   Office in Springfield. After losing a bid for the U.S. House of Representatives   in 1837, he became chairman of the Democratic State Committee and effectively   the manager of the Illinois Democratic Party. In 1840, Douglas was appointed   Secretary of State and used his position to lobby for an expansion of the   Illinois Supreme Court. In 1841, the legislature expanded the supreme court from   four to nine members and appointed Douglas as one of the new justices. In 1843,   he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives where he advocated a strong   expansionist policy, and twice won reelection to his seat. In 1847 Douglas was   elected to the U.S. Senate and named Chairman of the Committee on Territories.   In dealing with the sectional controversy to regulate slavery in the   territories, Douglas articulated the principle of “popular sovereignty.” This   attempt at a compromise on the slavery issue ultimately contributed to the   division of the Democratic party. In 1858, he won reelection to the U.S. Senate   over his opponent Abraham Lincoln. This heated battle for the senate seat   included the famous Lincoln-Douglas Debates that gave Lincoln national   recognition. In 1860, Douglas ran against Lincoln for the Presidency. After the   election, Douglas served on the Committee of Thirteen and supported the   ill-fated Crittenden resolution in an attempt to save the Union. He voiced   support for the Lincoln administration, and on April 25, 1861, delivered one of   his most famous pro-Union speeches in Springfield, Illinois. He contracted   typhoid fever shortly thereafter, and died on June 3, 1861, in Chicago,   Illinois. ",

Governor Thomas Carlin appointed Caton as an associate justice of the Illinois Supreme Court in 1842 to fill a vacancy on the court.  Governor Thomas Ford reappointed him in 1843 to fill another court vacancy.  The general assembly reappointed Caton to the bench when the Ford appointment expired.  With the adoption of a new state constitution in 1848, the voters elected Caton to one of the three positions on the Supreme Court.  He became Chief Justice when Samuel H. Treat resigned from the bench in 1855, and he became Chief Justice again in 1857.  Caton resigned from the court in 1864, having served nearly 22 years.  He was interested in telegraph lines and at one time controlled all such lines in Illinois until he leased them to the Western Union Telegraph Company.  A widely traveled man, Caton’s interest in natural history led to his publication of numerous pamphlets and papers on various subject.  Caton died on July 30, 1895, in Chicago, Illinois.  He is buried in Ottawa, Illinois.\n ",

Shields fought in the  Black Hawk War and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1832. A  Democrat, Shields was elected to the state legislature in 1836, and  that same year became auditor for the State of Illinois. As auditor,  Shields helped to correct the finances of the state after the Panic of  1837, but not without the criticism of the Whig press. Shields, in  response to anonymous charges made in the Illinois State Journal by  Abraham Lincoln and his fiancee Mary Todd, challenged Lincoln to a  duel. Lincoln admitted he had written the letters “wholly for political  effect” but Shields was not dissuaded. Mutual friends resolved the feud  before the duel. In 1843, Governor Thomas Ford appointed Shields to the  Illinois Supreme Court. He held that position for two years until his  resigned to accept an appointment as the commissioner of the General  Land Office in Washington, D.C. Shields served as brigadier general of  Illinois volunteers during the Mexican War and was critically wounded.  In 1848, he returned to Kaskaskia, Illinois, to resume his law  practice.

After Minnesota’s statehood, voters elected  Shields one of Minnesota’s U.S. Senators. After his term expired, he  moved to San Francisco, California, and then to Mexico. When the  American Civil War began, Shields became a brigadier general and  campaigned in the Shenandoah Valley. In 1863, he resigned his  commission and returned to San Francisco, where he accepted an  appointment as railroad commissioner. Three years later, Shields moved  to Carrollton, Missouri and reentered politics. In 1879, he was elected  to fill out an unexpired term in the U.S. Senate and became the only  person to have been a U.S. Senator from three different states.

In 1836, he moved to Rushville,   Illinois, where he edited a Whig newspaper, speculated in real estate, and   continued the practice of law. Dickey moved to Ottawa, Illinois, in 1839, and   with the outbreak of the Mexican War, he raised a company of volunteers and   served in the war as a commissioned captain. He returned to Ottawa, and in 1848,   he was elected judge of the Ninth Judicial Circuit. He occasionally served as   judge on the Eighth Judicial Circuit in the absence of Judge David Davis, and in   that capacity he ruled on numerous cases argued by Abraham Lincoln. He resigned   from the bench in 1853, but continued to practice law in Ottawa. Although he was   a delegate for the first Republican state convention of 1856, he supported   Stephen A. Douglas over Abraham Lincoln in both the 1858 senatorial and 1860   Presidential campaigns, speaking throughout the state on Douglas’s behalf.   During the Civil War, Dickey served as a colonel with the Fourth Illinois   Cavalry, and later, as a member of General Ulysses S. Grant’s staff (Chief of   Cavalry). As Assistant Attorney General for the United States from 1868 to 1870,   he was responsible for all suits in the court of claims and frequently appeared   in the United States Supreme Court.

Those initiatives include mandatory participation for the more than 900 Illinois Circuit and Associate judges in a Judicial Performance Evaluation Program, improvement to the New Judge Mentoring Program and New Judge Seminar; and a Statement of Expectations that was issued  to all Illinois judges in December 2009.Chief Justice Fitzgerald presided over the Illinois Senate's impeachment trial of former Governor Rod Blagojevich.
